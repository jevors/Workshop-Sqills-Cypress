Welcome to the **Cypress & Javascript basics** meetup!
These pages serve as a guideline for the hands-on workshop. 
You should find most information you need in this guide.

Before continuing with the exercises make sure you:
- Have checked out the project from GitHub
- Are able to run the client and server locally
- Added Cypress to the project as a dependency
- Are able to run the Cypress GUI on your machine

Each of these are explained step by step in the next sections. Just click `Installing the node.js project` in the bottom right of this page to get started.  

Have fun!
